### Fixed Point Explainability
This code contains the instructions to replicate the experiments for the paper "Fixed Point Explainability".

First things first, check that you have a working version of Python installed (this code works with 3.10.12), and create an environment in the root folder of this project:
```
python3 -m venv .env
```

Then install all the dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

There are 3 folders. We provide instructions for each of them.
